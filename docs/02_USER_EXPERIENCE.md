# 02. User Experience (The "Aura")

The app should not feel like a database tool. It should feel authoritative, fluid, and premium.

## Design Philosophy
*   **Visual Tone**: Deep aviation blues, crisp whites, metallic accents (silver/gold for certification tiers).
*   **Transitions**: No hard refreshes. Use smooth "morphing" transitions (e.g., a course card expanding to fill the screen).
*   **Interactions**: Micro-interactions (e.g., a "stamp" animation when a certificate is validated).
*   **Dark Mode**: "Night Flight" mode affecting the entire UI based on time of day.
